# Presets and Addons

## Presets

Presets are overrides that quality levels for easy customization.

You should only be using one preset at a time.

For more detailed information on what the presets set, you can check what [modules](https://github.com/mastercoms/mastercomfig/wiki/Modules) are [used in the presets](https://github.com/mastercoms/mastercomfig/tree/release/config/cfg/presets).

* **Ultra** — Absolute maximum quality without caring about performance.
* **High** — Enables graphical features without making them very high quality.
* **Medium High** — Disables unoptimized features and optimizes the game without making the game look bad.
* **Medium** — The maximum performance you can get while enabling a few effects that may give you a slight edge.
* **Medium Low** — The maximum performance you can get without making the game too hard to play because of awful visual quality and glitches.
* **Low** — Maximum performance without caring much about visibility or possible bugs.
* **Very Low** — Negatively affects playability by a lot and disables very essential features in desperation for performance.

## Addons

Addons are additional options that adjust the config and presets to suit more specific or niche use cases.

Any number of addons can be used together, unlike presets.

* **No Extra Models** — Removes extra models like rockets in the background, UFOs and UFO posters
* **No Footsteps** — Removes footstep sounds
* **No Pyroland** — Removes Pyroland map textures
* **No Soundscapes** — Remove soundscapes (ambient map noise)
* **No Tutorial** — Disables tutorial messages and other popups
* **Mouse Tweaks** — Some optional mouse tweaks that arguably improve mouse input. Also makes the sniper scope sensitivity the same as your normal sensitivity for 16:9 resolutions.
* **Transparent Viewmodels** — Enables support for transparent viewmodels. Note that this does not enable transparent viewmodels, your HUD must enable them. This only allows transparent viewmodels to work. Transparent viewmodels also require dxlevel 90 or higher.
* **Bad GPU** — Optimizations that generally do not affect quality for weak integrated graphics chips (Intel graphics) or weak/old GPUs (lower end made before 2007). Recommended to be used with the Medium Low, Low or Very Low presets. **WARNING: can potentially REDUCE performance on other graphics cards!!!**
* **Bad CPU** — Optimizations that generally do not affect quality for bad CPUs with two or less threads. Recommended to be used with the Low or Very Low presets. **WARNING: can potentially REDUCE performance on other CPUs!!!**
* **Slow I/O** — Optimizations that generally do not affect quality for slow disk drives
* **Low Memory** — Optimizations that generally do not affect quality for low memory (RAM) systems (4GB and lower)
